# Push Using GitHub Desktop

## Steps:

1. **Open GitHub Desktop**
   - Launch the GitHub Desktop application

2. **Add the Repository**
   - Click "File" → "Add Local Repository"
   - Click "Choose..." and navigate to:
     `/Users/sagar/Downloads/projects/beads-lens`
   - Click "Add Repository"

3. **Publish to GitHub**
   - GitHub Desktop should detect that this is a new repository
   - You should see a button that says "Publish repository" or "Publish to GitHub"
   - Click it
   - Repository name: `beads-lens`
   - Choose "Keep this code private" or uncheck it for public
   - Click "Publish Repository"

4. **That's it!**
   - GitHub Desktop will:
     - Create the repository on GitHub (if it doesn't exist)
     - Push all your commits
     - Set up the remote automatically
     - Handle authentication automatically

## If Repository Already Exists on GitHub:

If you've already created the repository on GitHub:

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. File → Add Local Repository → Choose the folder
3. GitHub Desktop might ask if you want to publish or if the repo already exists
4. If it exists, you can:
   - Click "Repository" → "Repository Settings" → "Remote"
   - Or just click "Push origin" button (top right)

## Verify:

After pushing, check:

You should see all your files there!
