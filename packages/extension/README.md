# Beads Lens Extension

Chrome MV3 extension for visualizing Beads project data (Ready, Blocked, Dependencies, Stats).

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd packages/extension
npm install
```

### 2. Build the Extension
```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles all TypeScript files to JavaScript in the same directory.

### 3. Load in Chrome
1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `packages/extension` folder
5. The extension should now be loaded!

## Development

### Watch Mode
During development, you can use watch mode to automatically rebuild when files change:
```bash
npm run watch
```

### File Structure
- `manifest.json` - Chrome extension configuration
- `background.ts` - Service worker for extension lifecycle
- `sidepanel.html/ts/css` - Main UI for viewing Beads data
- `options.html/ts/css` - Settings page for GitHub token and repos
- `content.ts` - Content script for PR page overlays
- `lib/` - Shared utilities (API, storage, schemas)

## Icons

You need to add icon files to the `icons/` directory:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

### Quick Way to Create Icons

1. Open `create-icons.html` in your browser
2. Right-click each icon and "Save image as"
3. Save them to the `icons/` folder with the correct names

Alternatively, you can create these using any image editor, or use an online tool like:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/

## Usage

1. **Configure Repositories**: Right-click the extension icon → Options, then add GitHub repositories (format: `owner/repo`)
2. **View Data**: Navigate to a GitHub repository page, then click the extension icon to open the side panel
3. **PR Overlay**: On GitHub PR pages, you'll see a "Beads Lens" badge that opens the side panel

## Requirements

- Node.js (for building TypeScript)
- Chrome browser (for testing)
- GitHub repository with `.beads/ui/*.json` files (generated by the exporter)

## Troubleshooting

### Extension won't load
- Make sure you've run `npm run build` first
- Check that all `.js` files exist (they're generated from `.ts` files)
- Verify `manifest.json` references `.js` files, not `.ts` files

### Can't fetch data
- Check that the repository has `.beads/ui/*.json` files
- For private repos, make sure you've added a GitHub Personal Access Token in Options
- Verify the repository format is correct: `owner/repo`

### Build errors
- Make sure you've run `npm install` first
- Check that TypeScript is installed: `npm list typescript`

## Next Steps

- See the main project README for setting up the Go exporter
- Check `prd-alpha.md` for full feature specifications
- Review `CONTRIBUTING.md` for development guidelines
