# Icon Generation Instructions

Since automatic icon generation requires additional image processing libraries,
please use one of these methods:

## Method 1: Using create-icons.html (Easiest)
1. Open create-icons.html in your browser
2. Right-click each icon and "Save image as"
3. Save to this folder as icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png

## Method 2: Using Online Tools
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Upload a 128x128 image and download all sizes

## Method 3: Using Image Editor
Create three PNG files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

Use a blue background (#0366d6) with a white 'B' or lens icon.
