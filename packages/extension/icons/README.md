# Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
1. Any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
2. Online tools like https://www.favicon-generator.org/
3. A simple design tool

The icons should represent "Beads Lens" - a simple "B" or lens icon would work well.

## Placeholder Icons

For development, you can create simple colored squares as placeholders:
- Create a 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel image
- Fill with a solid color (e.g., #0366d6 - blue)
- Save as PNG files with the names above

## Note

The extension will not load in Chrome without these icon files. Make sure to add them before loading the extension.
